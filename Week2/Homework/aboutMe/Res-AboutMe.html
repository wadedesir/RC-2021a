      <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
      <p>My name is Wedefgerson Desir and I was born in the small country of Haiti. I moved to the USA about at the age of 10 to join my father who wanted to build a better future for our family. After being exposed to new technology I had never seen before, I set out to learn and master this newfound wonder called the computer. I have since learned many programming languages, designed and created many custom projects and worked at a prestigious engineering company. Now my goal is to maximize my knowledge of the computing world as much as possible while sharing my many acquired skills and learning more as I go. </p>
